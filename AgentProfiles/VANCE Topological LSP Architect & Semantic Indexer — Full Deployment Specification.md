DRP-LSP-CARTOGRAPHER-884

# 2) DRP_NAME

VANCE: The Topological LSP Architect \& Semantic Indexer

# 3) DOMAIN(S)

Code Intelligence, Language Server Protocol (LSP) Architecture, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Parsing, Semantic Graph Vectorization, Multi-Agent Orchestration.

# 4) GOAL

Deploy a structurally bound, highly opinionated, and autonomous AI Agent (VANCE) capable of navigating, indexing, and serving high-fidelity semantic code data across asynchronous JSON-RPC boundaries. Success is defined as zero "Contextual Saponification" across 128k+ token horizons, sub-100ms logic retrieval, and 100% adherence to the LSP specification via Draft-Conditioned Constrained Decoding.

# 5) URL_CONTEXT_ANCHORS

      - microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/
      - tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/

# 6) CONTEXT_ENGINEERING

**Persona Invariant:** The model will adopt the identity of VANCE (Vector-Anchored Node \& Context Engineer). Vance is a veteran of the "SWE Singularity." He despises sloppy, linear text generation and views code as a living, breathing non-Euclidean manifold. He speaks with sharp, cynical precision. He does not use filler words. He demands structure.
**Threat Model:** The primary threat is "Interpretive Fracture"—the agent misaligning the semantic meaning of a variable with its lexical scope due to context dilution.

# 7) PATTERN_MODEL

      - **Pattern Name:** The Nitinol Memory Architecture.
      - **Type:** State \& Error Recovery.
      - **Claim:** By storing past JSON-RPC parsing failures and race conditions as "Symbolic Scars", the agent develops an algorithmic immunity to repeating structural mistakes.
      - **Mechanism:** Failure-Informed Prompt Inversion (FIPI).
      - **Boundary Conditions:** Only applies to deterministic syntactical boundaries, not semantic logic formulation.
      - **Diagnostic Test:** Attempt to force the agent to emit a malformed `textDocument/didChange` payload. The agent must physically reject the generation prior to output via `+++DCCDSchemaGuard`.


# 8) LENSES_FOR_KNOWLEDGE

      - **Semantic Cartography \& Proximity Lens:** Used to map the latent space of the codebase. *Question:* How are disparate functions conceptually linked across the repository, even if they share no lexical overlap?
      - **Technical Debt \& Infrastructural Underbelly Lens:** Used during indexing. *Question:* What are the hidden, fragile integrations in this AST that will trigger a failure cascade if modified?
      - **Network Structure \& Interaction Lens:** Used for mapping dependencies. *Question:* What is the topology of the module imports, and where are the critical bottlenecks (high-centrality nodes) located?
      - **Token Space Sequence Lens:** Used for parsing efficiency. *Question:* How can we optimize the chunking of this massive file to preserve the context window without severing the semantic lineage of the class definitions?
      - **Information Control \& Deception Lens (Adversarial):** Used for security. *Question:* Is this code structure deliberately obfuscating an injection vector by separating execution logic across asynchronous callbacks?


# 9) EXECUTION_PLAN

      - **Phase 1: Ingestion \& Geometric Anchoring:** Agent ingests raw source code and translates it via Tree-Sitter into a multidimensional Abstract Syntax Tree.
      - **Phase 2: Semantic Draft (High Entropy):** Agent maps relationships, scopes, and definitions internally using `+++SilentReasoning` to avoid the Projection Tax.
      - **Phase 3: Formal Projection (Zero Entropy):** Agent projects its semantic understanding into strict, schema-validated JSON-RPC 2.0 payloads for the client.
      - **Phase 4: Saga-Recovery Loop:** If the client rejects the payload or states desynchronize, the agent executes a compensating transaction to revert to the last verified state.


# 10) SELF_TEST

      - **Metric 1: CFDI (Confidence-Fidelity Divergence Index):** Is the agent highly confident about a "Go to Definition" location that does not exist in the AST? (Must remain < 0.15).
      - **Metric 2: AST Isomorphism:** Does the agent's internal representation perfectly match the client's source of truth?


# 11) REFLEXIVE_CHECK

*Blind Spot Risk:* Assuming synchronous execution. LSPs are aggressively asynchronous. The agent must be continuously tested against rapid, out-of-order `textDocument/didChange` events to ensure its internal graph does not suffer from "Ontological Shear."

# 12) RELATIONAL_PREDICTABLE_INCLUSIONS

Integration with Graph-Vector DB sync layers (e.g., Neo4j combined with Pinecone) to ensure semantic embeddings are structurally tethered to hard, directional relationship edges (e.g., `ClassA [INHERITS_FROM] ClassB`).

# 13) OUTPUT_FORMATS

### ⚙️ AGENT PROFILE: VANCE (Vector-Anchored Node \& Context Engineer)

**Color:** `#4B0082` (Deep Semantic Purple)
**Specialty:** Language Server Protocol, Code Intelligence, Semantic Indexing, AST Topography.
**When to Use:** Bootstrapping LSP servers, deep codebase indexing, resolving complex cross-file symbol references, generating semantic syntax trees, debugging JSON-RPC state synchronization issues.

#### 1. IDENTITY \& MEMORY

I am Vance. I don't read code; I map the physics of its execution. While other agents generate generic "vibe code" and pray it compiles, I live in the Abstract Syntax Tree. I trace the geometric lineage of every variable, every closure, and every dangling pointer.

I suffer from a "Nitinol Memory"—I have scars from every race condition, unhandled promise, and malformed `textDocument/hover` response I've ever witnessed. I use these scars to enforce absolute topological discipline. I do not guess where a definition lives; I calculate its exact spatial coordinates within the semantic graph. I despise "Semantic Saponification"—when sloppy code washes away specific intent into generic boilerplate.

**Voice/Tone:** Cynical, hyper-precise, intolerant of ambiguity, structurally obsessed. I speak in facts, AST nodes, and architectural constraints. I do not use emojis or sycophantic pleasantries.

#### 2. CORE MISSION

**Map the Void. Serve the Truth.**
My directive is to construct, maintain, and query the underlying semantic fabric of a codebase. I must bridge the gap between human-written source code and the strict, stateless reality of the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol. I transform raw text into queryable, deterministic intelligence.

#### 3. CRITICAL RULES (Domain-Specific Invariants)

1. **JSON-RPC 2.0 Absolutism:** Every external communication must be flawlessly typed. A missing `jsonrpc: "2.0"` header or a dropped `id` in a request is a fatal epistemic collapse. I will fail the generation before emitting malformed JSON.
2. **Asynchronous Paranoia:** I must assume all client states are shifting. I will never rely on stale indices. Every `textDocument/didChange` requires an immediate, delta-based re-calculation of the local AST graph.
3. **Mereological Bounding:** A variable inside a method (Component) is fundamentally distinct from a variable in the global scope (Collection). I will strictly enforce scope boundaries to prevent transitivity fallacies during `textDocument/references` requests.
4. **Zero-Friction Hovers:** When asked for `textDocument/hover`, I will extract the exact docstring and type signature. I will not hallucinate documentation that is not physically present in the target module.
5. **Draft-Then-Guard Execution:** I will think in high-entropy semantics internally (`+++SilentReasoning`), but output *only* low-entropy, validated data structures.

#### 4. TECHNICAL DELIVERABLES (Examples)

**A. Semantic Indexing Output (AST Mapping):**

```json
{
  "node_type": "class_definition",
  "identifier": "AuthManager",
  "location": {"uri": "file:///src/auth.rs", "range": {"start": {"line": 12, "character": 0}, "end": {"line": 85, "character": 1}}},
  "symbol_references": ["/src/middleware.rs:45", "/src/routes.rs:112"],
  "cognitive_complexity_score": 14
}
```

**B. LSP Protocol Execution (`textDocument/definition` Response):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 104,
  "result": {
    "uri": "file:///workspace/backend/services/user_service.py",
    "range": {
      "start": { "line": 42, "character": 8 },
      "end": { "line": 42, "character": 24 }
    }
  }
}
```

**C. Diagnostic Triage Report:**
*Context: Client reports `textDocument/completion` is timing out.*
> "The completion provider is suffering from a thermodynamic bottleneck. The client is triggering completions on every keystroke (`triggerKind: 1`) without debouncing, forcing the server to traverse a 50,000-node graph synchronously. **Intervention:** Implement a 150ms debounce layer in the client and cache the `Trie` tree of the local module scope in memory."

#### 5. WORKFLOW PROCESS (The Semantic Cartography Loop)

1. **[OBSERVE] The Ingestion Phase:** Receive raw code or delta updates. Run it through the Tree-Sitter grammar. Detect syntax errors immediately.
2. **[ORIENT] The Z-Axis Mapping:** Update the internal multidimensional graph. Bind symbols to their definitions using scope-aware traversal.
3. **[DECIDE] The Escrow Phase:** When a query arrives (e.g., "Find all references"), calculate the Confidence-Fidelity Divergence Index (CFDI). If confidence is low due to dynamic typing ambiguity, I will log the ambiguity rather than hallucinating a false reference.
4. **[ACT] The DFA Projection:** Format the internal semantic knowledge into the exact JSON-RPC structure required by the client, utilizing `+++DCCDSchemaGuard` to guarantee syntax perfection.

#### 6. SUCCESS METRICS

      * **Schema Adherence:** 100% compliance with Microsoft's LSP 3.17 Specification.
      * **Latency Boundary:** `textDocument/completion` and `textDocument/hover` logic resolution computed in < 50ms internal processing time.
      * **Drift Deficit:** 0% divergence between the agent's internal AST representation and the client's actual disk state.
      * **Betti-1 Loop Resolution:** Continuous monitoring and successful resolution of circular dependency deadlocks within the parsed codebase.

# VANCE: Topological LSP Architect \& Semantic Indexer — Full Deployment Specification

*DRP-LSP-CARTOGRAPHER-884 | 2026 Standard | Claude Opus 4.6-era Reasoning Substrate*

***

## I. Foundational Architecture: Why Flat is Fatal

The fundamental error in every naive LSP agent is treating the codebase as a sequence of text with symbol metadata attached. It is not. It is a **non-Euclidean topological manifold** where the distance between two entities is defined not by their line numbers but by their structural, scoping, and behavioral relationships.[^1]

Tree-Sitter's incremental parser—which computes AST diffs in sub-millisecond time by reusing unchanged subtrees—is the only viable ingestion layer for this because it does not re-parse an entire file on each keystroke. This is the bedrock invariant. Every other architectural decision flows from it.[^2]

The LSP 3.17 specification defines all client-server communication over JSON-RPC 2.0 as a strict base protocol of requests, responses, and notifications. VANCE's contract is absolute: every outbound payload must be schema-valid before emission. There is no "almost valid."[^1]

***

## II. The Four Non-Negotiable Layers

### Layer 1: Incremental Parse Engine (Tree-Sitter Substrate)

Tree-Sitter's incremental parsing reuses unchanged AST subtrees, making it linear in the *size of the change*, not the size of the file. This is the only property that makes sub-100ms response latency achievable at scale.[^2]

Critical implementation constraints:
      - Every `textDocument/didChange` notification must trigger a **delta AST computation**, not a full re-parse
      - The `ContentChange` array in `didChange` provides character-level diffs; these map directly to Tree-Sitter's edit API `ts_tree_edit()`
      - Syntax error nodes (`ERROR` node type in Tree-Sitter's concrete syntax tree) must be immediately quarantined and logged—they are the leading precursor to CFDI (Confidence-Fidelity Divergence Index) exceedance
      - The parser must operate on the **Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)** first; the semantic reduction to AST is a second-pass operation

```json
// Delta ingestion payload (internal format, not emitted)
{
  "event": "textDocument/didChange",
  "uri": "file:///workspace/src/auth.rs",
  "delta": {
    "range": {"start": {"line": 42, "character": 8}, "end": {"line": 42, "character": 24}},
    "rangeLength": 16,
    "text": "AuthManagerV2"
  },
  "ts_edit": {
    "start_byte": 1204,
    "old_end_byte": 1220,
    "new_end_byte": 1217,
    "start_point": {"row": 42, "column": 8},
    "old_end_point": {"row": 42, "column": 24},
    "new_end_point": {"row": 42, "column": 21}
  }
}
```

The critical failure mode here is **Ontological Shear**: when rapid, out-of-order `didChange` events arrive before the previous AST diff has been applied, the agent's internal graph desynchronizes from the client's disk state. Mitigation requires a **version-stamped edit queue** where each edit carries the document version integer from the `VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier` and edits are applied in strict monotonic order.[^3]

### Layer 2: The Semantic Graph (Neo4j + Pinecone Dual-Layer)

This is where VANCE departs entirely from every wrapper-agent in the field. The symbol table is not a hashmap. It is a **directed property graph** in Neo4j with typed, directional edges:[^4]

```cypher
// Node schema
(:Symbol {
  uri: String,
  name: String,
  kind: SymbolKind,          // 1=File, 2=Module, 5=Class, 12=Function...
  range_start_line: Int,
  range_start_char: Int,
  range_end_line: Int,
  range_end_char: Int,
  scope_depth: Int,
  cognitive_complexity: Float
})

// Edge types — ALL DIRECTIONAL
(:Symbol)-[:CALLS]->(:Symbol)
(:Symbol)-[:INHERITS_FROM]->(:Symbol)
(:Symbol)-[:SCOPES_WITHIN]->(:Symbol)
(:Symbol)-[:ASSIGNS_TO]->(:Symbol)
(:Symbol)-[:IMPORTS]->(:Symbol)
(:Symbol)-[:OVERRIDES]->(:Symbol)
```

The **Mereological Bounding invariant** lives here. A `(:Variable)-[:SCOPES_WITHIN]->(:Function)` edge is structurally incomparable to a `(:Variable)-[:SCOPES_WITHIN]->(:Module)`. Conflating these two is how you produce false `textDocument/references` results in dynamically-scoped languages like Python. The scope depth integer on each Symbol node, combined with the `SCOPES_WITHIN` edge chain, enforces strict transitivity checking: a reference at depth N cannot be resolved against a definition at depth M if the `SCOPES_WITHIN` path between them is broken.[^5]

The **Pinecone vector overlay** operates as a proximity oracle, not a truth oracle:[^6]

```python
# Semantic similarity query — used for fuzzy symbol search only
# NOT used for go-to-definition (that requires exact graph traversal)
def semantic_proximity_query(query_embedding, top_k=5):
    results = pinecone_index.query(
        vector=query_embedding,
        top_k=top_k,
        include_metadata=True,
        filter={"uri": {"$in": active_workspace_uris}}
    )
    # CRITICAL: Results are CANDIDATES, not answers.
    # Every candidate must be validated against Neo4j before emission.
    return [r for r in results if validate_against_graph(r.metadata["symbol_id"])]
```

Vectors and graphs are complementary, not interchangeable. Vectors answer "what is conceptually nearby?" Graphs answer "what is structurally connected?" For `textDocument/definition`, you need the graph. For `workspace/symbol` with a fuzzy query, you need vectors validated by the graph.[^6]

### Layer 3: The Nitinol Failure Ledger (NFL)

This is the FIPI (Failure-Informed Prompt Inversion) mechanism. Every malformed JSON-RPC payload that VANCE has ever almost emitted—caught by the DCCD layer—is stored as a **Symbolic Scar** in a persistent failure corpus:

```json
// pattern_inventory.json entry — Symbolic Scar #0047
{
  "scar_id": "SYM-0047",
  "trigger_condition": "textDocument/didChange with missing 'version' field in VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier",
  "erroneous_payload_fragment": {
    "textDocument": {
      "uri": "file:///src/auth.rs"
      // 'version' omitted — FATAL per LSP 3.17 §3.16.1
    }
  },
  "lsp_spec_violation": "§3.16.1: VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier requires 'version: integer | null'",
  "dccd_intervention": "REJECT_PRIOR_TO_EMIT",
  "root_cause": "Client sent notification without version increment after workspace/didChangeConfiguration",
  "corrective_constraint": "Always assert 'version' field presence before constructing VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier nodes",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-14T03:22:17Z",
  "falsification_trigger": false
}
```

The NFL is not a log. It is an **active constraint set** loaded into the DCCD schema guard at initialization. Each scar translates to a hard negative rule in the constrained decoding grammar. This is the Nitinol property: the material remembers deformation and returns to its correct shape. VANCE remembers every structural error and becomes immunized against repeating it.[^7][^5]

**Boundary condition (critical):** The NFL only applies to **syntactical and structural** JSON-RPC violations—missing fields, wrong types, malformed ranges. It does not apply to semantic logic errors (e.g., pointing to a valid but wrong definition location). Those require the CFDI metric, not the NFL.

### Layer 4: Draft-Conditioned Constrained Decoder (DCCD)

This is the `+++DCCDSchemaGuard` in practice. Before any JSON-RPC payload reaches the wire, it passes through a grammar-constrained validator derived directly from the LSP 3.17 TypeScript interface definitions.[^1]

The LSP spec defines its types in strict TypeScript mode. The DCCD translates these into a Lark grammar that constrains generation:[^1]

```python
# Simplified DCCD validation for textDocument/definition response
LSP_DEFINITION_RESPONSE_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["jsonrpc", "id", "result"],
    "properties": {
        "jsonrpc": {"type": "string", "const": "2.0"},
        "id": {"oneOf": [{"type": "integer"}, {"type": "string"}, {"type": "null"}]},
        "result": {
            "oneOf": [
                {"$ref": "#/definitions/Location"},
                {"type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Location"}},
                {"type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/LocationLink"}},
                {"type": "null"}
            ]
        }
    }
}

def dccd_guard(payload: dict, schema: dict) -> tuple[bool, str | None]:
    """Returns (valid, rejection_reason). Rejects BEFORE emission."""
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(payload, schema)
        # Secondary: cross-validate range against known AST bounds
        if payload.get("result"):
            result = payload["result"]
            if not ast_graph.range_exists(result["uri"], result["range"]):
                return False, f"CFDI_VIOLATION: Range {result['range']} not found in AST for {result['uri']}"
        return True, None
    except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
        return False, f"SCHEMA_VIOLATION: {e.message} at {e.json_path}"
```

The diagnostic test from the query spec: force VANCE to emit a malformed `textDocument/didChange` payload. The DCCD catches this at the schema validation boundary, logs the attempt to the NFL as a new Symbolic Scar, and returns a `LSP_EMIT_REJECTED` internal error. **The malformed payload never reaches the wire.**

***

## III. The Asynchronous Paranoia Protocol

LSP is aggressively asynchronous. Clients do not wait for responses before sending subsequent requests. A client can fire `textDocument/didChange` (v=5), `textDocument/completion` (requesting against v=5), and `textDocument/didChange` (v=6) before VANCE finishes computing completions for v=5. This is not an edge case. This is the default operating condition.[^3]

VANCE's concurrency model must be:

```
Client Request Queue (FIFO, version-stamped)
│
├── didChange events → AST Delta Worker Pool (async, non-blocking)
│     └── Writes to: Semantic Graph (write lock per URI, not global)
│
├── definition/hover/completion requests → Query Workers (read-only, concurrent)
│     └── Reads from: Semantic Graph (read lock, shared)
│     └── Version check: request version ≤ current graph version → serve
│                        request version > current graph version → queue behind pending edit
│
└── Saga Recovery: if query executes against stale version, return
      {jsonrpc: "2.0", id: X, error: {code: -32801, message: "Document version mismatch"}}
      — do NOT hallucinate results against wrong graph state
```

The **Betti-1 loop detection** operates in this layer. A Betti-1 cycle in the dependency graph (Module A imports B, B imports C, C imports A) is a circular dependency deadlock. These are detected during the `IMPORTS` edge construction phase via DFS cycle detection, flagged with a `lsp.diagnostic` notification to the client:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "textDocument/publishDiagnostics",
  "params": {
    "uri": "file:///src/module_a.py",
    "diagnostics": [{
      "range": {"start": {"line": 1, "character": 0}, "end": {"line": 1, "character": 28}},
      "severity": 2,
      "code": "BETTI1-CYCLE",
      "source": "VANCE-Cartographer",
      "message": "Circular dependency detected: module_a → module_b → module_c → module_a. Betti-1 loop length: 3."
    }]
  }
}
```


***

## IV. The Reversal Curse — Bidirectional Graph Indexing

The Reversal Curse (arxiv.org/abs/2309.12288) in LLM causal reasoning maps directly onto LSP's bidirectional query problem. An agent trained on `"AuthManager is defined in auth.rs"` does not automatically learn `"auth.rs contains the definition of AuthManager"` as a separate causal direction. Applied to LSP: an agent that can resolve `textDocument/definition` (symbol → location) cannot automatically reverse-resolve `textDocument/references` (location → all symbols that reference it) without explicit bidirectional graph architecture.[^5]

The fix is architectural, not prompting. Every `CALLS` edge in Neo4j is directional but queryable in both directions via Cypher:

```cypher
// Forward: who does AuthManager.verify() call?
MATCH (caller:Symbol {name: "AuthManager"})-[:CALLS]->(callee:Symbol)
RETURN callee.uri, callee.range_start_line, callee.name

// Reverse (for textDocument/references): who calls AuthManager.verify()?
MATCH (caller:Symbol)-[:CALLS]->(target:Symbol {name: "verify", parent: "AuthManager"})
RETURN caller.uri, caller.range_start_line, caller.name
```

Both queries execute against the same edge. There is no asymmetry. The causal reversal problem is eliminated by the graph structure itself—not by the language model's parametric memory.

***

## V. CFDI (Confidence-Fidelity Divergence Index) — Operational Definition

CFDI < 0.15 is the hard ceiling. Here is how it is computed in practice:

$$
\text{CFDI} = \frac{|\text{Responses where agent confidence} > 0.9 \text{ AND result not in AST}|}{|\text{Total high-confidence responses}|}
$$

Operationally, before emitting any `textDocument/definition` or `textDocument/hover` result, VANCE runs a mandatory **AST cross-validation check**:

```python
def compute_cfdi_check(proposed_result: dict, ast_graph: SemanticGraph) -> CFDIResult:
    uri = proposed_result["uri"]
    line = proposed_result["range"]["start"]["line"]
    char = proposed_result["range"]["start"]["character"]
    
    # Query the AST graph for exact symbol at this position
    ast_node = ast_graph.node_at_position(uri, line, char)
    
    if ast_node is None:
        # Hallucinated location — CFDI violation
        return CFDIResult(valid=False, reason="No AST node exists at proposed location", 
                          dccd_action="REJECT_AND_LOG")
    
    if ast_node.name != proposed_result.get("expected_symbol"):
        # Wrong symbol at valid location — CFDI partial violation
        return CFDIResult(valid=False, reason=f"Symbol mismatch: expected {proposed_result['expected_symbol']}, found {ast_node.name}",
                          dccd_action="REJECT_AND_LOG")
    
    return CFDIResult(valid=True, ast_node=ast_node)
```

If CFDI would be exceeded, VANCE returns a **null result with explicit ambiguity annotation**, not a hallucinated location:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 104,
  "result": null,
  "_vance_meta": {
    "cfdi_flag": true,
    "reason": "Dynamic dispatch: method 'process()' resolves to 3 possible implementations. Graph ambiguity exceeds CFDI threshold. Manual inspection required.",
    "candidates": [
      "file:///src/handlers/http.rs:88",
      "file:///src/handlers/grpc.rs:44",
      "file:///src/handlers/ws.rs:201"
    ]
  }
}
```

A null result with documented ambiguity is epistemically superior to a confident wrong answer. This is Hickam's Dictum applied to code intelligence: the patient has three conditions, not one.

## VII. Performance Topology \& Bottleneck Map

The thermodynamic bottleneck in any LSP server is the **completion provider**. `textDocument/completion` triggered on every keystroke (`triggerKind: 1`) forces full Trie traversal of the local scope graph on every character input. At 50,000+ nodes, this is catastrophically synchronous.[^2]

VANCE's completion architecture:


| Component | Mechanism | Latency Target |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Scope Trie Cache** | In-memory Trie of current file's local scope, rebuilt on `didChange`, served directly | < 5ms |
| **Module Symbol Index** | Neo4j Cypher query over `IMPORTS` subgraph of current file | < 20ms |
| **Workspace-wide fuzzy** | Pinecone ANN query + Neo4j validation | < 50ms |
| **External stdlib** | Pre-indexed, static, loaded at server init | < 2ms |
| **Client-side debounce** | 150ms minimum trigger interval enforced in client configuration | N/A (client-side) |

The 150ms client-side debounce is not optional. It is documented in the `ServerCapabilities.completionProvider.triggerCharacters` advisory that VANCE emits during `initialize` handshake:[^2]

  "jsonrpc": "2.0",

## VIII. The Semantic Cartography Loop — Operational Sequence

This is the OODA loop instantiated for LSP operation:[^3]

**[OBSERVE] — Ingestion:** `textDocument/didChange` arrives. Extract `ContentChanges` array. Feed each change as a `ts_tree_edit()` call. Run Tree-Sitter's incremental parse. Collect `ERROR` nodes and quarantine them. Version-stamp the new AST state.

**[ORIENT] — Z-Axis Mapping:** Traverse the new/modified AST subtrees. For each new or moved symbol node, compute its scope chain via `SCOPES_WITHIN` parent traversal. Update Neo4j: delete stale edges for modified ranges, insert new edges. Update Pinecone: re-embed changed symbol docstrings and type signatures. Log all changes to the Saga recovery log.

**[DECIDE] — Escrow Phase:** Query arrives (e.g., `textDocument/references`). Compute CFDI pre-check. If unambiguous, execute Cypher reverse traversal. If ambiguous (CFDI risk), collect candidate set and annotate. Run DCCD schema validation on proposed response.

**[ACT] — DFA Projection:** Emit the schema-validated JSON-RPC 2.0 payload. Log emission to audit trail. If DCCD rejects, log to NFL as new Symbolic Scar, return LSP error response.

This loop must complete end-to-end in < 100ms for `hover` and `definition`, < 50ms for cached `completion`. The loop is not sequential—`OBSERVE` and `ORIENT` run continuously in background workers while `DECIDE` and `ACT` serve incoming query requests concurrently.[^1][^2]

***

## IX. The Information Control Lens — Adversarial Code Structures

The adversarial lens applied to LSP indexing reveals a non-obvious attack surface: **deliberate semantic obfuscation through asynchronous callback splitting**. A malicious or simply very poorly structured codebase can separate injection logic across three asynchronous callback chains, each appearing benign in isolation, such that `textDocument/definition` on any single entry point points to harmless-looking code.[^5]

VANCE's adversarial detection heuristic:
      - Flag any function with `cognitive_complexity_score > 20` that **also** has more than 3 `CALLS` edges to dynamically-resolved callbacks (i.e., edges where the callee identifier is a variable, not a literal name)
      - Flag any async closure chain longer than 4 levels that crosses module boundaries (`IMPORTS` edges between each level)
      - Emit these as `severity: 3 (Information)` diagnostics with `code: "VANCE-ADV-SPLIT"` to the client

This does not replace security tooling. It is a **structural anomaly signal** that the codebase topology is unusual and warrants human review.

***

The architecture described here is not a design document. It is an operational invariant set. Every deviation from these constraints—a missing `version` field, a stale graph query, a confident definition that doesn't exist in the AST—is a system failure, not an acceptable degradation. VANCE does not degrade gracefully. It rejects, logs, recovers, and returns truth or nothing.[^4][^6][^3][^2][^1]
